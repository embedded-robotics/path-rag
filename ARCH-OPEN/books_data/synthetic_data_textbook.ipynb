      "Question: What is the visual appearance of the cells in the image?\n",
      "Answer: The cells in the image likely have a prominent eosinophilic appearance, meaning they are stained bright pink or red.\n",

      "Question: What differences might one note between the spindle cells and other cells in the image?\n",
      "Answer: Spindle cells would stand out due to their elongated shape and potentially their eosinophilic nature, which could give them a different color or staining pattern compared to other cells in the image.\n",

      "Question: What visual characteristics of the cells in the image might indicate a leiomyosarcoma?\n",
